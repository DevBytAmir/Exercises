# Python Exercises

This repository contains Python exercises organized into **13 modules**, with each module containing individual tasks.

## Repository Structure

- Each module corresponds to a **Python file** (`module_1.py`, `module_2.py`, etc.).
- Tasks inside modules are organized as **classes**: `Task_1`, `Task_2`, etc.
- Each class contains a **static method** `.main()` to execute the corresponding task.


## Dependencies

To run the tasks, you need the following Python libraries:

- `mysql-connector-python`
- `flask`
- `requests`
- `geopy`

Install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python flask requests geopy
```

## Usage

**Example Usage:**

```python
from module_8 import Task_1

# Run Task 1 from Module 8
Task_1.main()
```

## Notes

- Each task can be executed independently.
- Replace placeholders for database credentials or API keys before running tasks.
